= Flow Pagination Example

An example rails app using the will_paginate and flow_pagination gems together

== Requirements

* mexpolk-flow_pagination (http://github.com/mexpolk/flow_pagination/tree/master)
* haml gem (http://haml-lang.com/)
* faker (http://faker.rubyforge.org/)
* populator (http://github.com/ryanb/populator/tree/master)
* Rails 2.3.3 (http://www.rubyonrails.org)

== Install

Checkout the sources:

  git clone git://github.com/mexpolk/flow_pagination_example.git

Install the required gems, from the command line run:

  sudo gem install haml
  sudo gem install faker
  sudo gem install populator
  sudo gem install mexpolk-flow_pagination

== Usage

After you checked out this application, you'll need to create and populate your
database. From the command line type the folloging (you must be in the root
directory of the application):

  rake db:migrate
  rake db:populate

This will create a 100 records so you can test the pagination renderer.
Once completed the above task run your server:

  script/server

And enter the application (http://localhost:3000). You'll be redirected to the
categories/index action. The application should display the first 30 results.
Below the records you'll find a button that says "More", click on it and you
will get the next 30 records right after the previos records.

Done!

== Notes

What I did in this app:

* config/environment.rb: Configured mislav-will_paginate and
mexpolk-flow_pagination gems.
* app/views/categories/index.html.haml: Here we use Mislav's will_paginate plugin
as usual, the only change is where we set a custom renderer:

  = will_paginate @categories, :renderer => FlowPagination::LinkRenderer
